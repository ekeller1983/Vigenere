A Vigenere implementation for C++

Done for a class on data objects, and stored on github for potential employers to browse.

If for some reason you actually wish to use the class, then it should be fairly self evident on what each function does. Take note that the constructor assigns a cipher and sets cI (cipher index) to 0; this is important if you switch phrases to encrypt/decrypt and should always be set to 0 for a new phrase or else it will get treated as part of the old phrase. In short, just init a new vigenere class when moving to another phrase.
